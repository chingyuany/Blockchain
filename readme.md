This program is to simulate the BlockChain and Bitcoin transaction for different users.  

•	The program will creating elliptic curve (EC) public key pairs for six different users first.  
•	Create transactions for the 6 users.  
•	Create a Merkle tree for the transactions.  
•	Create genesis block.  
•	Add set of five blocks to the genesis block.  
•	Provide within the program verification that each cryptographic primitive is being done correctly.
